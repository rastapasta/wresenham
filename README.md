# wresenham - B*resenham* line algorithm with *W*idth

A JavaScript library to calculate all points on a line, given two points and a stroke width.

## How does it work?

* Inspired by [Alois Zingl's "The Beauty of Bresenham's Algorithm"](http://members.chello.at/~easyfilter/bresenham.html)
* Falls back to [bresenham](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham) for width < 1
* All points points in the given line are passed to the callback.

## How to install

Install it into your project with
```
npm install --save wresenham
```

## How to use it

```js
const wresenham = require('wresenham');

let from = [0, 0];
let to = [4, 4];
let width = 2;

wresenham(from, to, width, (x, y) => console.log(x, y));
```
